          The bobcat (<i>Lynx Rufus</i>) is also known as the bay lynx or wildcat.
          It has large paws, long legs, a short body, and tufted ears.
          100 centimeters long and 60 centimeters tall at the shoulders is the largest you'll see the bobcat
          and it won't get any smaller than 60 centimeters long and 50 cm tall at the shoulders.
          If you weighed one, you would see that it is 7-15 kilograms.
          Looking closer, you'd see that it has stiffer fur than a Lynx and that it is pale brown or reddish with black spots.
          Because it's fur is stiffer, it happens to be less valuable than that of a Lynx.
          Its underparts and some of its tail, which is between 7 and 15 centimeters long, are white.

        The bobcat is a close relative to the larger Canada lynx, but isn't able to live in climates as cold as one.
        It prefers to cozy up between southern Canada and southern Mexico.
        From forests to deserts, bobcats can be seen primarily in the United States.
        However, you'll never really be able to get very close to one because they are frightened by humans.
        It is quite rare if you are ever attacked by one, unless its ill.
        Keeping populations from getting out of hand, bobcats eat rodents, rabbits, hares, and even some birds.<br/>

      <h3>Population</h3>
      <p>
        The bobcat's mating season is usually in the late-winter and it'll take about 50-60 days to produce 1-6 baby bobcats, or kittens.
        All these kittens have resulted in a bobcat population that could be anywhere from 2-3 million.
        They usually live about 7 years and die due to hunters, themselves, and even diseases from eating rodents contaminated with rat poison.
