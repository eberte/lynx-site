            The bobcat (<i>Lynx Rufus</i>) is also known as the bay lynx or wildcat.
            It has large paws, long legs, a short body, and tufted ears.
            A bobcat can get as long as 60-100cm and can get as tall as 50-60cm tall at the shoulders.
            If you weighed one, you would see that it is 7-15 kilograms.
            Looking closer, you'd see that it has stiffer fur than the other types of Lynx and that it is pale brown or reddish with black spots.
            Because it's fur is stiffer, it happens to be less valuable than that of another type of Lynx.
            A bobcat's tail can be 7-15cm long and is usually partially white, like the underside of one.

          The bobcat is a close relative to the larger Canada lynx, but isn't able to live in climates as cold as its relative.
          It prefers to cozy up between southern Canada and southern Mexico.
          From forests to deserts, bobcats can be seen primarily in the United States.
          However, you'll never really be able to get very close to one because they are frightened by humans.
          It is quite rare if you are ever attacked by one, unless it's ill.

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>
          The bobcat's mating season is usually in the late-winter and the gestation period will take about 50-60 days to give birth to 1-6 baby bobcats, or kittens.
          The bobcat population could be anywhere from 2-3 million.
          Their lifespan usually lasts about 7 years and some threats include hunters, other bobcats, and even diseases from eating rodents contaminated with rat poison.
