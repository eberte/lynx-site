    <strong>Habitat</strong>:
    <br>
    The Canada Lynx typically live in forested areas with cold winters and
    their primary prey, the snowshoe hare. They use the forest's undergrowth and fallen trees for
    making their dens. Their habitat spans from Canada to the northern United States such as Maine,
    Minnesota, and Washington.
    </br>
    <br>
    <strong>Diet</strong>:
    </br>
    While the Canada Lynx's main prey is the snowshoe hare, they will also eat mice, red squirrels, grouse
    and carrion.
    </br>

    <strong>Population</strong>:
    </br>
    In the year 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Canada Lynx as a threatened
    species. However, in December of 2017, they started drafting a rule that they would be taken off the
    list due to protective measures towards snow-loving big cats.
    </br>
    <br>
    <strong>Reproduction</strong>:
    </br>
    The Canada Lynx have a mating season from March to May. Their gestation period lasts about 63-70 days
    so the babies are born in May or June. Usually, a litter of lynxes contains 1-5 kittens. They usually
    give birth and store their kittens underneath a pre-existing physical feature like a root system or a
    fallen tree rather than create a place for their den. The kittens will stay with their mother for
    a year while learning how to hunt.
