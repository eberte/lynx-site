<div id = "Habitat"><h3>Habitat</h3>
<br>
  Iberian Lynx live only in the woodlands and thickets of Spain and Portugal.
They generally only live in altitudes between 400 meters and 1,300 meters. These
lynx like to have scrub and brush for protection and shelter, but also open pastures
for hunting. With the recent fragmentation of their habitats, however, many Lynx
live in more mountainous areas. </div>

<p>
  Iberian Lynx live solitary lives, only coming together to mate. They set their
  boundaries using scratches and urine. They will use man made borders to set their
territories as well, such as roads or fences. the average territory size is
5 to 20 km&sup;. </p></div>

<p>
  The main compoenant of an Iberian Lynx's diet is the European Rabbit. This is
one of the reasons that the speicies is so endangered. The already dwindling
population of rabbits is suceptible to epidemics such as myxomitosis, making their
population recovery slow. The Iberian Lynx population follows suit. </div>
<div id = "Pop"><h3>Populations</h3>
<p>
  The Iberian Lynx is currently downgraded from critically endangered to
  endangered. There are currently 400 lynx in the wild. Iberian Lynx gestate for
  two months and give birth to one to three kits ata a time.
