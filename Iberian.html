<br>
  Iberian Lynx live only in the woodlands and thickets of the Iberian penninsula.
They generally only live in altitudes between 400 meters and 1,300 meters. These
lynx like to have scrub and brush for protection and shelter, but also open pastures
for hunting. With the recent fragmentation of their habitats, however, many Lynx
live in more mountainous areas. </div>
<div id = "Behavior" style= "width: 50%" ><h3>Behavior</h3>
<br>
  Iberian lynx live solitary lives, only coming together to mate. Young lynx can
roam around but once borders are set between two territories, they tend to be
consistantly kept. They often set their boundaries </div>
<div id = "Food" style= "width: 50%" ><h3>Food</h3>
<br>
  The main compoenant of an Iberian Lynx's deit is the European Rabbit. This is
on of the reasons that the speicies is so endangered. The already dwindling
population of rabbits is suceptible to epidemics such as myxomitosis, making their
population recovery slow. The Iberian Lynx population follows suit. </div>
