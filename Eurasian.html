Habitat
</h3>
<p style="width: 550">
Eurasian Lynx are mainly found in dense forests, but also are commonly found on rocky areas such as mountain peaks or inland cliffs. Though very rare, Eurasian Lynx can also be found in desert and humid areas.
</p>
<h3> Behavior</h3>

<p style ="width: 550">
  Eurasian Lynx are crepuscular creatures, meaning they are mainly active during dawn and dusk, and in between find themselves resting under tall grasses or thick shrubs. They are mainly terrestrial creatures that excel in climbing, but can also swim.<br>
Eurasian Lynx are solitary besides mating season, as most cats are, meaning the only long lasting relationship Eursian Lynx truly develop is between mother and cub. However, male and female communicate through scent marks by overlapping their territories, which is how they are able to mate.<br>
Breeding season focuses on February and March, which is typical of cold weather cats which have their cubs in time for spring and summer so that they properly adapt and grow strong before winter arrives. Female Eurasian Lynx typically birth 2-3 kittens at a time. They are fully weaned within 6 months after birth and become completely independent after 10 months. In captivity Eurasian Lynx can live up to their 20s, but typically die in their teens in the wild.
<h3>Diet/Food</h3>
<p style = "width: 550">
  As exceptionally powerful hunters, Eurasian Lynx mainly hunt roe deer whenever they are available, but often hunt small mammals and game birds as well. They are also very strict carnivores.
</p>
<h3>Population</h3>
<p style = "width: 550">
  Eurasian Lynx are mainly found in Europe, parts of the Middle East and Asia, as far as the Tibetan Plateau. However, Eurasian Lynx population in Western Europe are now fragmented and very small. The population worldwide is 50,000, the majority of which live in China and Russia.<br>
Primarily threatened by illegal hunting for fur, though habitat loss and lack of prey species are also threats to Eurasian Lynx. Natural threats are few, occasionally other animals such as wolves will opportunistically kill them.
