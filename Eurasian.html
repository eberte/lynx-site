 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p style="width:550">
   Eurasian Lynx <i>(Lynx Lynx)</i> come in a variety of different colors and patterns depending on their locality. British lynx, which are very similar to the Northern European lynx, are usually gray with a light spotted belly. Moving further south youâ€™ll see Eurasian Lynx tend to be more red and brown. Their coat color also varies with the seasons; red and brown are common with the warmer months of the year while gray and silver are common during winter. Eurasian Lynx tend to be between 80 to 130 cm length, weighing around 18 to 40kgs. Eurasian Lynx are fast predators, mainly due to their long legs and huge webbed paws. They have a long white and gray ruff around their neck and face and also a black tipped tail around 8 inches long. Their coats are very thick and double layered for protection against the cold weather.

Eurasian Lynx are mainly found in dense forests, but also are commonly found on rocky areas such as mountain peaks or inland cliffs. Though very rare, Eurasian Lynx can also be found in desert and humid areas.

  Eurasian Lynx are mainly found in dense forests, but also are commonly found on rocky areas such as mountain peaks or inland cliffs. Though very rare, Eurasian Lynx can also be found in desert and humid areas. They are crepuscular creatures, meaning they are mainly active during dawn and dusk, and in between find themselves resting under tall grasses or thick shrubs. They are mainly terrestrial creatures that excel in climbing, but can also swim. As exceptionally powerful hunters, Eurasian Lynx are strict carnivores that mainly hunt roe deer whenever they are available, but often hunt small mammals and game birds as well.

  <h3> Population </h3>
  <p style = "width: 550">
Eurasian Lynx are mainly found in Europe, parts of the Middle East and Asia, and stretch as far as the Tibetan Plateau. However, Eurasian Lynx population in Western Europe are now fragmented and very small due to various threats. The population worldwide is 50,000, the majority of them in China and Russia.<br>
Eurasian Lynx are primarily threatened by illegal fur hunting, but also die from habitat loss and lack of prey species. Natural threats are few to Eurasian Lynx, though other animals such as wolves will opportunistically kill them.<br>
Eurasian Lynx are solitary besides mating season, as most cats are, meaning the only long lasting relationship Euran Lynx truly develop is between mother and cub. However, male and female communicate through scent marks by overlapping their territories, which is how they are able to mate. Breeding season focuses on February and March, which is typical of cold weather cats which have their cubs in time for spring and summer so that they properly adapt and grow strong before winter arrives. Female Eurasian Lynx typically birth 2-3 kittens at a time. They are fully weaned within 6 months after birth and become completely independent after 10 months. In captivity Eurasian Lynx can live up to their 20s, but typically die in their teens in the wild.
