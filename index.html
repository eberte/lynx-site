    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to spread awareness about the stable/
      critically endangered species. The lynx species as a whole is doing
      just fine, but there is an extension of the species, the Iberian Lynx,
      whose population is in terrible shape, hints the "critically endangered"
      aspect of the species' label. This site will enlighten the reader with
      information about the four types of lynx, the Iberian lynx, Canada lynx,
      Eurasian lynx and the Bobcat.

      behavior, diets, etc.
