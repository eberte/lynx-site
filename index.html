    <p> The purpose of this site is to spread awareness of this critically
      endangered/stable species. Rainbow six siege has nothing to do with this
      site, but I have “writer’s block” so I am just writing to write and
      because I love R6 so much, I always seem to come to this topic, which
      is possibly concerning, but my teacher told me to just WRITE so I’m
      just writing about whatever I can to pass the time, but also to get
      out of this writer’s block. Do you need to have started something to
      actually HAVE writer’s block? Because I haven’t actually started writing
      the intro to our site, which kind of stinks, because I need to get
      something written before my time is up.
