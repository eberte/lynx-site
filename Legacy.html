    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Lynx occupy much of what is now the North american, Asian, and European Continents.
      The ancestor of the modern species Lynx is the Issiodorensis, which resided in Europe.
      Lynx are a part of the Mammalia class in the Felidae family.
      Lynx are strictly carnivorous (only eat meat).

    <h3>
      Compare/ Contrast to Other Cats
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lynx(50-70 cm) are a relatively large cat,  similar in size to the leopard
      (60-70 cm) and jaguar(63-76 cm),
      just smaller than cougars(60-90 cm) and cheetahs(70-90 cm).
      The average house cat has a top speed of 47.96 kph, the lion : 79.98 kph,
      the cheetah : 120.06 kph, and the lynx : 80.47 kph.
      The average house cat can jump around 2.44 meters high,
      while the lynx only jumps around 1.98 meters.

    <h3>
      Extinct Species
    </h3>
        <h4>
          Issiodorensis
        </h4>
          <p>
            The Issoire lynx (<i>Lynx issiodorensis</i>) is an extinct species of lynx
            that inhabited Europe during the late Pliocene to Pleistocene (about 2.58 million years ago  to 11,700 years ago) epochs,
            and originated in Africa during the late Pliocene (5.333 million to 2.58 million years ago).
            It is named after the town of Issoire where the first remains were found.
            It probably became extinct during the end of the last glacial period.
            It is generally considered as the ancestor of all four species of lynx alive today.
            Its skeleton resembled that of living lynxes,
            but it had shorter and more robust limbs, with a larger head and longer neck.
            As a result, the Issoire lynx more closely resembled a typical member of the cat family than do its extant descendants.
