          <p>
            Lynx occupy much of what is now the North American, Asian, and European Continents.
            The ancestor of the modern lynx species is the Issiodorensis, which resided in Europe.
            Lynx are a part of the Mammalia class in the Felidae family.
            Lynx are strictly carnivorous (only eat meat).

                  The Issoire Lynx (<i>Lynx issiodorensis</i>) is an extinct species of lynx
                  that inhabited Europe during the late Pliocene(5.333 million to 2.58 million years ago) to Pleistocene (about 2.58 million years ago  to 11,700 years ago) epochs,
                  and originated in Africa during the late Pliocene.
                  It is named after the town of Issoire where the first remains were found.
                  It probably became extinct during the end of the last glacial period.
                  It is generally considered as the ancestor of all four species of lynx alive today.
                  Its skeleton resembled that of living lynxes,
                  but it had shorter and more robust limbs, with a larger head and longer neck.
                  As a result, the Issoire lynx more closely resembled a typical member of the cat family than do its extant descendants.
